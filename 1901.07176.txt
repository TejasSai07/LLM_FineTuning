ABSTRACT
Word representations are created using analogy context-based
statistics and lexical relations on words. Word representations are
inputs for the learning models in Natural Language Understanding
(NLU) tasks. However, to understand language, knowing only the
context is not sufficient. Reading between the lines is a key
component of NLU. Embedding deeper word relationships which
are not represented in the context enhances the word representation.
This paper presents a word embedding which combines an analogy,
context-based statistics using Word2Vec, and deeper word
relationships using Conceptnet, to create an expanded word
representation. In order to fine-tune the word representation, SelfOrganizing Map is used to optimize it. The proposed word
representation is compared with semantic word representations
for the prediction
representations has shown to be capable of representing the
similarity and association between words. The proposed word
representation shows a Spearman correlation score of 0.886 and
provided the best results when compared to the current state-of-theart methods, and exceed the human performance of 0.78.

1. INTRODUCTION
Most Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models use word
representations for their inputs [3]. Word representations are used
for question answering [5] [6], machine translation [7], dialog
systems [8], text understanding [9], and named entity recognition
[10].
The commonly used word representations are those created using
semantic representation and the lexical information of the local
context and the global context [3]. A semantic word representations
can demonstrate, ‚ÄúKing to queen is to man to woman‚Äù, (kingqueen=man-woman) [11]. GloVe [12] and Word2Vec[1] are the
man is to woman
holding a semantic relationship. GloVe uses a global word cooccurrence count, which uses the statistic of the corpus and the
semantics of the words in the corpus to create a vector for the words
[12]. Word2Vec, a predictive model, uses the context words to
predict the target word. Word2Vec uses a feedforward network [1]
for the prediction. Both GloVe and Word2Vec use large text corpus
to create the context-derived word representations.
NLU relies on understanding the context by using information not
expressed in the context, which normally requires reading between
the lines. Communication requires more information than the
current context which is believed to be known by the listener [13].
Retaining more information in a learning model is shown to
improve performance over models that do not retain information
[14]. Conceptnet is a general knowledge graph comprising of words

and their relationships [15]. It contains the knowledge that can be
provided for better word representations. However, there is a
limitation on containing the semantic knowledge, which is also
important in word embedding.
This paper presents a model which combines semantic knowledge
and knowledge-graph extracted knowledge for a given word to
create word representations. The resulting word representation
contains more relationships and knowledge than semantic models.
A higher weight is given to the semantic word representation to
avoid over-generalization of the final word representation. The
proposed model is evaluated using SimLex-999 [16]. Furthermore,
to illustrate the capability of differentiating association and
similarity, the word embedding is represented in 3D graphs as
presented in this paper.
The contributions of the paper are to i) provide a method to generate
a word representation that combines Semantic knowledge and
knowledge-graph information, ii) evaluate and demonstrate the
ability of such a word representation in capturing both similarity
and association between words.

2. BACKGROUND
Word representations have moved from lexical based to semanticbased to provide information-rich word representations. The early
word representations, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) hold the
statistical representations on the corpus. LSA is a low-dimensional
word representation based on the term-document frequency. These
models fail at co-occurrences with general words (e.g. and, a, the,
etc.).
Later, Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) [17] and
Hellinger Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [18] were used to
generate vector representations for words. The word representation
was generalized and could be used for many natural language
processing tasks. However, these cannot be used for language
understanding [19]. The semantic-based vector representations
have shown the potential for improving the understanding of
learning models [5]. The semantic word representations produce
dimensions of meaning and hold the distributed representation for
the words. Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBoW) and skip-gram
model shows linguistic patterns as linear relationships between the
word vectors. This linear relationship is used to demonstrate the
related words in a word representation. Learning based natural
language processing applications using this representation would
not receive the full meaning representation of the words since it
does not use the co-occurrence statistics of the corpus.
GloVe addresses the problems faced by the skip-gram model which
did not focus on the statistics of the corpus. In addition, GloVe has
the capability of achieving analogy tasks. Therefore, based on the
context, GloVe supports a higher level of meaning representation
[12]. Word2Vec also uses the co-occurrence statistics from the
corpus [20] and the semantics of the corpus. Word2Vec and GloVe

are contexts depended. Therefore, depending on the context the
vector representation has drastic changes. The word representations
and the relationships are based only on the textual context. The
word representation does not hold information that is not available
in the context.
Conceptnets‚Äô knowledge graph is used to create word
representation [21] and language understanding [14]. Furthermore,
to support language understanding, Conceptnet is used for word
representations, using PPMI and expanded retrofitting [22]. The
PPMI creates the term-term matrix from the corpus text. The
context of a term would be the terms that appear nearby in the text
by using sparse matrices. The sparse matrices are used to derive
word embedding. The expanded retrofitting using Concepnet uses
the multilingual connections to learn English words from language
translation. However, the word representations do not consider
context-based statistics and analogy. Therefore, it loses the
information embedded in a textual context.
Semantics is a key element to provide an understanding of the
textual context. However, understanding context does not rely only
on the textual context [23]. NLU requires the capability of
understanding analogy and corpus statistic. However, to gain
further knowledge and understanding deeper relationships that are
not visible in the context but known by the listener is required.
Conceptnet was developed with the intention of providing the
general knowledge for natural language understanding tasks [15].
Conceptnet provides related words and relationships connected to
a given the word. These connected words and relationships provide
hidden knowledge on the textual context. However, the Conceptnet
does not provide complete information such as corpus statistic to
provide complete natural language understanding. Therefore, it is
the aim of this paper to propose a better word embedding.

The embedding creates a 300-row vector for each word
representation. 300-row vector was chosen as it presented the best
results from the experiments that were conducted by comparing 50,
100, 300, and 500 vector sizes. The embedding consists of the
following two main embedding; semantic word embedding, and
generalized word embedding.
The semantic and knowledge-graph embedding are combined to
create one-word embedding, representing both a semantic and
general word representation. These two embeddings are necessary
to clearly understand words in a given context. Figure 1 presented
a summary of the steps that will be described as follows.

3.1 Semantic Word Embedding
Semantic word embedding is used to embed the meaning expressed
through the textual context. Semantic word embedding is generated
through Word2Vec. Equation (1) gives the word (ùë§) is embedded
using Word2Vec to create an initial word embedding which holds
the word similarity. The vector (ùë£) holds the word similarity
depending on the context the word appears.

ùë£ = ùëäùëúùëüùëë2ùëâùëíùëê(ùë§)

3. METHODOLOGY
This section discusses word embedding that takes into account the
semantic relationships and the relationships which are not visible
in the textual context. GloVe and Word2Vec use word embedding
based on semantic relationships. However, the word embedding is
context dependent. To avoid context dependencies and to allow a
general representation, Conceptnet and Word2Vec are combined.
This combination makes it possible of expressing similarity and
association for word embedding which is not available in
Word2Vec and GloVe.
The proposed word embedding gives the word w with a final vector
representation of ùë£ùëì , which encompass more complete relationship
of ùë§ with a deeper relationship with other words. ùë£ùëì combines a
semantic representation and a context independent representation
for a given word. Therefore, this embedding is capable of
representing the embedded meaning even though it is not visible in
the textual context.

However, the semantic approach only addresses the similarity
between words fail to handle the association between words.
Association between words is not visible through the context. To
address associations as well as similarities that are not visible in
context, Conceptnet [21] is used. The set of n related words ùë§ùëêùëõ to
the word w , are extracted from Conceptnet 1 . Equation (2)
demonstrates the results drawn from the Conceptnet for the word
ùë§ and generates related words ùë§ùëêùëõ .

which consists of ùëõ related words extracted from Conceptnet for
the given word w since each word w from Conceptnet would hold
20 related words on average, i.e. n=20. The extracted words ùë§ùëêùëõ
are converted into vectors ùë£ùëêùëõ using a pre-trained Word2Vec. The
pre-training of Word2Vec pre-training was done on the Wikipedia
dataset and create 300 row vector for each word. Each of the
extracted words is used to create its own vector (3). The model
creates ùë£ùëêùëõ , which is a set of n vectors for each word w, and each
one of these n vectors consists of 300 elements as presented in
Word2Vec. The vectors ùë£ùëê1 to ùë£ùëêùëõ are added together.

vector representation is vc n . Extracting words from Conceptnet,
would contain similar words and associated words with ùë§ [15].
Therefore, adding the vector representations together would
generate a generalized vector representation, which holds
association and similarity relationships with ùë§ . Therefore,
embedding the associated words and similar words through the use
of Conceptnet generates a word embedding which is generalized.
However, a higher weight should be given to semantic word
representation directly from the word, w. For this, a Word2Vec
representation v is created for the word w directly as well.
Equation (4), the v is separately multiplied with the word
embedding created through Conceptnet. The vector representation
( vcm ) holds both similarity representation (through the Word2Vec
and Conceptnet) and the association representation (through
Conceptnet). Therefore, vcm holds deeper relationships that extend
the semantic relationships that are extracted and generated from the
available context. Therefore, vcm for w would be hold the
association relationships and similarity relationships.

by using SOM. The word embedding could produce a closer
relationship within neighbors. The ùë£cm 300-row vector is reshaped
to a 2D metrics to pass it to the SOM. ùë£cm is considered a center
and the four nearest neighbors based on the Euclidean distance is
passed through the SOM. In order to map ùë£cm to the Kohnen‚Äôs
layer, the vector ùë£cm is reshaped into a 2D matrices. The Kohnen‚Äôs
layer would run for 500 iterations, with a learning rate (a) of 0.005.
This would produce a new 2D representation for each word. The
2D representation will be transformed into a vector ùë£f using PCA.
Through the use of PCA the dimension reduction is applied to the
2D metric to create the final ùë£f . The ùë£f is calculated for each word
representation ùë§ùëêùëõ as shown in (5).

ùë£f = ‚àëùëõùëñ=1[ùë£ùëêùëö + ùëé(ùë£ùëêùëñ ‚àí ùë£ùëêùëö )]

ùë£f creates a clear distinction between similar words compared to
associated words.

association. In order to perform achieve a high score, the word
embedding should be able to capture similarity independently to the
relatedness and association. Therefore, SimLex-999 has shown to
be a challenging evaluation model compared to WordSim-353 [25].
The proposed word embedding demonstrates the capability of

differentiating similarity from association and relatedness which is
reflected in table 1. The context to create the word embedding in
order to test on SimLex-999 is created based on Common Crawl
data2.The proposed word embedding is evaluated using SimLex999 [16]. SimLex-999 dataset to Spearman‚Äôs œÅ correlation between
words is calculated and presented in Table 1. Table 1 compares the
proposed model with [1] , [2] and [4]. The Spearman‚Äôs correlation
shows that the proposed model is achieving higher Spearman‚Äôs
correlations compared to the semantic word representations. This
also shows that the proposed model can differentiate the similarity
and association, as the proposed model uses Conceptnet to support
generalization and Word2Vec to provide a semantic similarity. We
have extended the normal 2D word embedding representation [12]
into a 3D word representation using the existing distant measure.
The proposed word embedding in a 3D representation is shown in
Figure 2 for ‚Äúdog, mouse, chair, table, car, bus, man, queen,
woman, king‚Äù. The proposed 3D word representations places
humans on one plane, vehicles on another plane and objects are
placed in another plane with animals but closer to the plane
representing humans. Furthermore, the similarities between man to
woman is less than queen to king. The proposed word embedding
capture more than the gender representation unlike Word2Vec (see
Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the general vector representation created
through Conceptnet. This shows a clear representation and is
capable of distinguishing association and similarity of the words
[16].
3D comparison between the Word2Vec (Fig. 3) and Conceptnet
based word embedding (Fig. 4) is shown. The relationship between
king to queen and man to woman are similar, but the similarities
between them are different as shown in Figure 2 when compared to
the word representation using Word2Vec as shown in Figure 3 or
using Conceptnet as shown in Figure 4. The vector representation
created using only Conceptnet is not context dependent shows a
general representation which does not capture similarity between
words. This also shows that similarity, association or relatedness
cannot be captured by pre-determined relationships which the
words hold with each other.
To demonstrate the application of the word representation, for
sentences a sample context from the bAbI dataset is used [26].

more sentences shows the dynamics nature of proposed word
representation (Figure 7).

5. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a word embedding that uses context-based
statistics, analogy and deeper related meaning of words to create
word representations. The proposed word embedding holds both
context-based information via Word2Vec and deep related words
via Conceptnet on the words. The word representation uses a higher
weight to the context-based information to create the word
representation preventing over generalization. The word
representation is evaluated using SimLex-999 which achieved a
Spearman‚Äôs correlation of 0.886. Furthermore, the proposed word
representations are displayed in 3D representation to show the
capability of distinguishing the associated words to similar words
based on context. The proposed word embedding is similar to the
human performance of word similarity and association by
achieving a Spearman‚Äôs correlation of 0.886 given a human can
achieve 0.78 [16].
