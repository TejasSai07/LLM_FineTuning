# BERT and LLM Fine-Tuning Framework

This repository provides implementations for fine-tuning BERT and other large language models (LLMs) using various approaches to optimize performance for NLP tasks such as text classification and summarization. It includes:

Fine-Tuning with PyTorch:
Detailed implementation of BERT fine-tuning using a conventional PyTorch workflow, including tokenization, custom data handling, and model training loops with optimizers.

Pipeline-based Approach:
Simplified BERT fine-tuning and inference using Hugging Face's pipeline, streamlining the setup and execution for tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization.

End-to-End LLM Workflow:
Custom scripts to train and evaluate language models, demonstrating both flexibility and scalability for fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific datasets.
